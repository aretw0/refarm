// The connection probe loop — bring a declared connection up and decide readiness by
// ASKING THE SYSTEM, never by matching a string in the process's output.
//
// This mirrors `browser-driver`'s `awaitLoginDetected(probe, signals)`: the probe decides,
// the signals inform. Output here produces only human notices; a missed notice can never
// make a connection wrongly considered up or down.
//
// Both the process (a channel of output chunks) and the probe (a closure) are INJECTED, so
// this whole loop is unit-tested with no real process and no real command.
