# Refarm Package Registry

This document catalogues the modular primitives and engines of the Refarm monorepo.

## 📦 Core Engines

| Package | Purpose | Maturity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`@refarm.dev/tractor`](./tractor) | The Sovereign Microkernel & Plugin Host | 🟡 Stable-ish | Internal |
| [`@refarm.dev/windmill`](./windmill) | Automation Engine & Infrastructure | 🟠 Alpha | Internal |
| [`@refarm.dev/health`](./health) | Stratified Health & Policy Auditor | 🟢 Production | Release-profiled; held |

## 🛡 Capability Contracts (v1)
These packages define foundational interoperability layers between Refarm and
its plugins. They are release-policy candidates, not an automatic publish list:
publication remains held by the daily-driver gate or explicit human override.

| Package | Tests | Status | Publishing |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`@refarm.dev/storage-contract-v1`](./storage-contract-v1) | ✅ Conformance | 🟢 Candidate | `kernel-candidates`; held |
| [`@refarm.dev/sync-contract-v1`](./sync-contract-v1) | ✅ Conformance | 🟢 Candidate | `kernel-candidates`; held |
| [`@refarm.dev/identity-contract-v1`](./identity-contract-v1) | ✅ Conformance | 🟢 Candidate | `kernel-candidates`; held |
| [`@refarm.dev/channel-policy-v1`](./channel-policy-v1) | ✅ Fixture Validation | 🟡 Candidate | `kernel-candidates` + `vault-seed-ready`; held |

## 🔖 Plugin Metadata
This layer waits for the Pi and multi-layer plugin architecture proofs before entering the release lane.

| Package | Tests | Status | Publishing |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`@refarm.dev/plugin-manifest`](./plugin-manifest) | ✅ Validation | 🟡 Deferred | v0.2.0+ candidate |

## 🔌 Storage & Identity Adapters

| Package | Type | Backend | Maturity |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`@refarm.dev/storage-sqlite`](./storage-sqlite) | Storage | OPFS/SQLite | 🟡 Beta |
| [`@refarm.dev/storage-memory`](./storage-memory) | Storage | In-Memory | 🟢 Stable |
| [`@refarm.me/identity-nostr`](./identity-nostr) | Identity | Nostr/Relays | 🟠 Alpha (Experimental) |
| [`@refarm.dev/sync-crdt`](./sync-crdt) | Sync | Automerge-like | 🟠 Alpha |

## 🏗 Sub-systems & Utilities
