# TEM Sovereign Graph — Design Specification
**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Status:** Approved
**Authors:** Collaborative brainstorming session (user + Claude)

## 1. Problem Statement

The Refarm OS is a local-first operating system built around a **Sovereign Graph** — a JSON-LD
graph of resources, permissions, and user interactions. As the system grows, it needs a
reasoning engine capable of:

1. Learning the **relational topology** of the graph without centralized training
2. Predicting what resources/capabilities are likely to appear together
3. Detecting **novelty** — flagging when a pattern hasn't been seen before
4. Doing all of the above **in-browser, in real-time, without backpropagation**

At the same time, the current plugin architecture has a gap: a plugin's `manifest.targets`
declares what environments it can run in (browser, server, remote) but cannot declare
**execution context** — whether it should run on the main thread, in a WebWorker,
ServiceWorker, or edge runtime. This limits performance and portability.

---

## 2. Solution Overview

We adapt the **Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine** (TEM, Whittington et al. 2020) as a reasoning
engine for the Sovereign Graph, deployed as a WASM plugin running in a WebWorker — and
simultaneously extend the plugin architecture to formally support arbitrary execution contexts.

The TEM is chosen because it uniquely separates:
- **Structural knowledge** (grid cells `g`) — the topology of who connects to whom
- **Sensory content** (place cells `p`) — what data appears at each node

This mirrors exactly what the Sovereign Graph needs: learning that "after a `storeNode`
of type `PluginManifest`, a `queryNodes` of type `PluginTrustGrant` often follows" is
structural knowledge — independent of the actual plugin content.

### Three Streams

#### G-stream: Abstract Location (Grid Cells / MEC)
- Tracks **where in the graph** the agent is, independent of what data is there
- Updated by **path integration**: `g_t[f] = RNN(g_{t-1}[f], action_t)` per frequency module
- Multi-frequency factorization: 5 modules with `n_g = [10, 10, 8, 6, 6]` neurons each
- Emergent: grid cells, band cells, border cells arise at different frequencies

#### X-stream: Sensory Input
- The actual observation: what the agent perceives at the current node
- In our context: a struct-aware embedding of the `SovereignNode` and `TelemetryEvent`

#### P-stream: Grounded Location (Place Cells / Hippocampus)
- **Binds** abstract location (g) with sensory content (x)
- `n_p[f] = 3 × n_g[f]` neurons per module (tripling for conjunction)
- `sumP = 120` total place cell neurons → 120×120 Hebbian memory matrix

### Hebbian Memory

The core of episodic memory. Updated every step, non-differentiably:

```
M_t = clamp(λ × M_{t-1} + η × (p_inf ⊗ p_inf − p_gen ⊗ p_gen), −1, +1)
```

Where:
- `η = 0.5` — Hebbian learning rate
- `λ = 0.9999` — exponential forgetting (enables rapid learning without catastrophic interference)
- `p_inf` — place cells inferred from current observation (ground truth)
- `p_gen` — place cells predicted from abstract location (before seeing observation)
- The difference is the **prediction error signal**: strengthens associations where inference corrects prediction

### Attractor Retrieval (Pattern Completion)

Retrieves full place-cell patterns from partial cues:

```
h_0 = project(g_t)       // Initialize from abstract location
for i in 0..K:
  h_{i+1} = kappa × h_i + h_i @ M
  h_{i+1} = clip(h_{i+1}, −1, +1)
p_retrieved = h_K
```

K = 10 fixed iterations, kappa = 0.8. Converges to stored patterns in associative memory.

### Inference-Time Compute

~160k FLOPs per step (batch size 1):
- RNN forward: O(40 × 20) ≈ 800 ops
- Conjunction: O(120²) ≈ 14,400 ops
- Attractor (K=10): O(10 × 120²) ≈ 144,000 ops
- Hebbian update: O(120²) ≈ 14,400 ops

Fast enough for browser event-stream latency. Under 1ms per step in V8.

## 4. Design Decisions

### D1 — Deployment Model: TEM as WASM Plugin in WebWorker

TEM lives as a WASM plugin (not Tractor core), loaded by Tractor like any other plugin.
It runs in a dedicated WebWorker via `Comlink` for non-blocking inference.

**Why not Tractor core?**
Embedding TEM in Tractor would couple the reasoning engine to the microkernel, making it
harder to upgrade, swap, or disable. The plugin model maintains sovereignty: TEM can be
replaced by any other plugin that implements `TemApi`.

**Why WebWorker?**
The Hebbian update + attractor loop, while fast, should not block the main thread. More
importantly, TEM as a Worker plugin is the **canonical reference implementation** for the
`executionContext` extension described in D2.

### D2 — Plugin executionContext Extension

The `PluginManifest` is extended with:

```typescript
executionContext?: {
  preferred: "main-thread" | "worker" | "service-worker" | "node" | "edge";
  fallback?: ExecutionContextType;   // e.g. "main-thread" for iOS Safari
  allowed: ExecutionContextType[];
}
```

`PluginHost` grows a `PluginRunner` abstraction with two initial implementations:
- `MainThreadRunner` — current JCO-based behavior, used by default
- `WorkerRunner` — Comlink-based, instantiates plugin WASM inside a Worker thread

The `WorkerRunner` handles the fallback automatically: if `Worker` is unavailable (iOS Safari
in some contexts), it falls back to `MainThreadRunner` transparently.

**Why now?**
WebLLM and Transformers.js are on the Refarm roadmap. Both are computationally heavy and
must not block the main thread. Establishing `executionContext` now means those integrations
inherit the pattern without architectural debt.

### D3 — Weights Strategy: Hybrid toward Full TypeScript Rewrite

**Phase 1 (current):** Export torch_tem RNN and conjunction weights via ONNX, load via
`ort-web`. Hebbian memory always runs in pure TypeScript (no ONNX needed for this part).

**Phase 2 (target):** Build `@refarm.dev/tem-codegen` CLI that:
- Reads `TEM_model.py` and `checkpoint.pt` from the torch_tem repo
- Generates TypeScript files with embedded `Float32Array` weight literals
- Eliminates `ort-web` runtime dependency (~2MB)
- Enables full TypeScript inspection and testing

**Why codegen over manual rewrite?**
Manually rewriting preserves no link to the upstream research. The codegen approach means
when Whittington et al. publish TEM v2, running one command updates the TypeScript
implementation. Research and production stay in sync automatically.

### D4 — Action Space Mapping

TEM actions drive the grid-cell (structural) stream. Each `TelemetryEvent.event` string
maps to a 1-hot integer index:

| TelemetryEvent | Action index |
|----------------|-------------|
| `storage:io.storeNode` | 0 |
| `storage:io.queryNodes` | 1 |
| `plugin:load` | 2 |
| `plugin:terminate` | 3 |
| `api:call.OutputApi` | 4 |
| `api:call.IdentityApi` | 5 |
| `system:command_executed` | 6 |
| `system:security:*` | 7 |
| ... | up to n_actions = 16 |

Actions represent **transitions in the capability graph** — the structural topology that TEM's
grid cells learn to represent.

### D5 — Struct-Aware Observation Encoding

Observations drive the sensory (place-cell) stream. Rather than treating a `SovereignNode` as
an opaque blob, the encoder uses the JSON-LD schema to assign **stable dimensional slots**:

```
dims 0–15:   @type  (ontology hierarchy embedding)
dims 16–31:  identity fields (pluginId, owner, @id URN structure)
dims 32–47:  relational fields (provides, requires, references)
dims 48–55:  temporal fields (clock, createdAt, expiresAt)
dims 56–63:  payload hash (content fingerprint)
```

**Why struct-aware?**
Two nodes of different types that share the same semantic role (e.g., both have `pluginId`)
will encode that field in the same dimensional slot. TEM learns: "whenever dims 16–23 have
this pattern, action 4 is likely next" — regardless of node type. This is **cross-type
relational learning** without explicit type engineering.

**Upgrade path:**
Slot 56–63 (payload hash) is the first candidate for Transformers.js semantic embeddings in v2.
The `ObsEncoder` interface is injectable — swapping the payload slot requires no changes to
TEM core. The slot structure ensures the other 56 dimensions remain compatible.

The slot assignments are auto-generated from `schemas/sovereign-graph.jsonld` at build time,
so adding new property categories to the ontology automatically updates the encoder.

### D6 — TEM Architecture Constants for JS Port

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `n_g` | [10, 10, 8, 6, 6] | Grid cell neurons per frequency module |
| `n_p` | [30, 30, 24, 18, 18] | Place cell neurons (3× conjunction tripling) |
| `sumP` | 120 | Total place cells → 120×120 Hebbian matrix |
| `eta` | 0.5 | Hebbian learning rate |
| `lambda` | 0.9999 | Exponential memory decay per step |
| `kappa` | 0.8 | Attractor damping coefficient |
| `K_attractor` | 10 | Fixed attractor iterations |

## 5. Sovereign Graph Mapping

| TEM Concept | Sovereign Graph Analogue |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Grid cells `g` | Abstract position in capability/resource topology |
| Place cells `p` | "Where in this specific instance" — bound to actual nodes |
| Sensory input `x` | SovereignNode metadata + TelemetryEvent payload |
| Action `a` | API call type + target plugin (graph traversal step) |
| Hebbian memory `M` | Episodic memory: what co-occurs at what locations |
| Attractor retrieval | Pattern completion: "given this action history, expect..." |
| Novelty score | Prediction error: `||x_predicted - x_actual||` |
| Reset walk | New plugin load / session start / context switch |

**What TEM learns:**
After observing the Sovereign Graph, TEM's grid cells develop representations of the
capability topology — which plugins connect to which, which API calls follow which events.
The Hebbian memory encodes which node *contents* appear at which topological positions.
This enables: "If I'm at a `PluginManifest` node and call `plugin:load`, I'll see a
`PluginTrustGrant` node with these identity fields."

    p-inferred: list<float32>,
    novelty-score: float32,
    prediction-confidence: float32,
  }

## 8. Out of Scope (this iteration)

- Pre-training torch_tem on synthetic Refarm graphs (separate Python task)
- Transformers.js payload embedding (v2 upgrade path; ObsEncoder interface enables it)
- ServiceWorker, Node, Edge runners (architecture supports; implement after Worker proven)
- CRDT sync of Hebbian memory across devices (SyncAdapter extension required)
- Codegen CLI (Step 6 of plan) — can be deferred until core inference works
