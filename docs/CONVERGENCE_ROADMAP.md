# Convergence Roadmap — Rolling Out the Carpet

> Status: working roadmap (2026-06-24). Sequences every sub-project the convergence needs so
> work can start without re-deciding direction. Governed by
> [`ECOSYSTEM_SUPPLY_MAP.md`](./ECOSYSTEM_SUPPLY_MAP.md) and the 2026-06-24 amendment in
> [`VAULT_SEED_CONVERGENCE.md`](./VAULT_SEED_CONVERGENCE.md).

## How to read this

The convergence is not one plan — it is a sequence of sub-projects. Each one runs its own
`brainstorm → spec → plan → execute` cycle (the librarian, item 1, is the worked example).
This roadmap fixes **what** each sub-project is, **why**, what it **depends on**, its **readiness
gate** (dogfooding: Refarm consumes it first), and its **artifact type**. It does not pre-write
implementation plans for sub-projects whose design decisions are not made yet — those come from
each sub-project's own brainstorm.

## Sub-projects

## Detail & rationale

### 1. Librarian (done — spec + plan)
`source:v1` contract + `source-git` impl. Unblocks everything: once Refarm can materialize a
clean read-only copy of any repo, it can absorb logic from the ecosystem instead of guessing.
Deferred pieces (`source-dispatch`, `source-local`, `tarball`) tracked in item 7.

### 2. `apps/refarm` promotion audit — recommended next
The accepted critique: `apps/refarm` (1.2M) may concentrate logic that should be reusable blocks.
Concrete smell already visible: `src/renderers.ts` and `src/model-routing.ts` live in the app, but
multi-surface rendering belongs in `homestead`/`dispatch-surface`, and model routing is a
candidate primitive. This sub-project is **discovery, not build**: read `apps/refarm/src` and
produce a promotion ledger — for each unit, "stays in app" vs "promote to `ds`/`homestead`/
`dispatch-surface`/a contract", with the reason. It is cheap, mostly doable read-only, it
operationalizes the dogfooding gate ("apps are thin consumers that prove blocks"), and it is the
direct input to item 4. It is also the first real act of Refarm-absorbing-the-ecosystem — the
librarian's spirit (read to learn) applied to Refarm's own app.

### 3. npm scope decision
`DISTRIBUTION_STATUS.md` publishes contracts as `@aretw0/*`; the live packages are named
`@refarm.dev/*`. Downstream cannot `import { x } from "@…/…"` until the scope is fixed. This is a
governance ADR (decide the scope, the migration mechanics, and the personal→org timing) plus a
mechanical rename/publish-config migration. No code dependency — can be decided early, in
parallel with item 2.

Execution packet: `specs/features/2026-06-25-npm-scope-doc-sweep.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-npm-scope-doc-sweep.md`.

### 4. UI/surface blocks supply — the one the consumer cares most about
Grow `ds` (today: tokens + styles + one Button) and consolidate `homestead` (sdk/ui/styles) +
`dispatch-surface` + `terminal-plugin` into the official block set that consumers compose product
from (cli/tui/web/rpc/http/a2a). Readiness gate: the Refarm admin UI itself is composed from the
blocks, not from app-local code (that is what item 2's audit makes possible). This is where the
boundary amendment becomes real.

**Reframed by item 2's audit** ([ledger](./APPS_REFARM_PROMOTION_LEDGER.md)): the blocks already
exist and Refarm already consumes them — this is **not** an extraction effort. Scope is: grow `ds`
(nascent), make `homestead`/`dispatch-surface` externally consumable (scope + docs + stable API),
and reconcile `credentials/` ↔ `silo`. Raises the weight of item 3 (external blocks need a settled
npm scope).

### 5. WASM distribution substrate
Make Tractor (ADR-049 dual-runtime; ADR-044 browser WASM loading) the common distribution layer
for lab/site surfaces. Treat Marimo (Python→WASM via Pyodide) and Astro 7 (Rust toolchain) as two
language surfaces over one substrate, not two embedded apps. **Requires research first** — Astro 7
is recent; verify its toolchain/WASM story (context7/web) before committing an ADR. Output: an ADR
plus a proof that one surface (the lab or the site) distributes through the substrate.

### 6. `dgk-skills` ⊂ refarm gardening skills
`dgk-skills` (read, search, create, context, daily) is a subset of a broader Refarm gardening
skill set. Map the overlap, define the superset, and provide a compatibility adapter so a
`dgk` skill can run under Refarm's skill surface without a one-shot rename (the convergence doc's
"Skill/package compatibility" promotion candidate).

Activation packet: `specs/features/2026-06-25-skill-runtime-activation.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-skill-runtime-activation.md`.

### 7. Librarian completion (deferred)
`source-dispatch` adapter (wire `source:v1` into `dispatch-surface` for agentic/kernel use) and a
real `source-local` package (live local tree). Built when consumed — `source-dispatch` waits on
item 4's dispatch work; `source-local` waits on a consumer wanting the live tree.

Activation packet: `specs/features/2026-06-25-source-adapter-activation.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-source-adapter-activation.md`.

### 8. Consumer bridges (deferred)
Promote `dgk`'s repeated needs into Refarm packages only when a second consumer needs the same
primitive: `silo` (credentials), `contacts`+`rate-limiter` (channels), `cli/launch-process`
(runner). Gated by the dogfood and by the convergence doc's "promote only when consumer-neutral"
rule.

Activation packet: `specs/features/2026-06-25-consumer-bridges-activation.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-consumer-bridges-activation.md`.

### 9. Executable specs (generators + codemods)
Prose specs are right for **decisions** (ADRs) but low-leverage for **mechanical** work. Three
layers, three forms: greenfield → **generator** (Refarm already has `turbo gen package` with typed
templates incl. `contract-v1`); recurring transform of existing code → **codemod** (the gate-list
registration — done now by extending the generator's `modify` actions); one-off/cross-file AST
transforms → lean on the ecosystem (`codemod.com` / `ast-grep` / `ts-morph`) when a change spans
many files (e.g. the `credentials/` re-export migration). **Delivered:** the gate-registration +
changeset are now emitted by `turbo gen package` (`turbo/generators/config.ts`), turning
`PACKAGE_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md` steps 2/3/6 from prose into code. **Discipline:** codemod-ify the
recurring, keep one-offs and decisions as prose.

Codemod registry packet: `specs/features/2026-06-25-codemod-registry-contract.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-codemod-registry-contract.md`.

### 11. XR/WebXR surface POC (frontier)
XR is a surface around Refarm, not a core dependency. The first work is a POC that renders the same
Refarm data through a 2D `homestead` fallback and an XR-capable WebXR path. It must keep A-Frame or
three.js isolated to the POC until evidence justifies a package.

POC packet: `specs/features/2026-06-25-xr-surface-poc.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-xr-surface-poc.md`.

## Working rule

Each numbered item gets its own `brainstorm → spec → plan` before execution. Specs land in
`specs/features/` or `specs/ADRs/`; plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Planning frontier

These are the next things worth deepening before writing broad code. They are deliberately phrased
as codemod/generator work when a repeatable transform is cheaper and safer than manual edits.

1. **Astro 7 / WASM substrate research (item 5):** current Astro is v7, so the next artifact should
   be a POC plan, not a speculative ADR. Test one Astro SSR route against Tractor's
   native-first/WASM-fallback substrate and decide whether Part C survives.
2. **Generator-first vault-seed distribution:** define the smallest `refarm gen vault-seed` contract
   that can materialize the template, run the generated-vault smoke suite, and keep template-only
   files behind the `initialize.yml` boundary. Spec:
   `specs/features/2026-06-25-vault-seed-generator-contract.md`.
3. **Codemod candidates:** only codemod recurring transforms: package gate registration,
   `@aretw0` -> `@refarm.dev` publish-target sweeps, `CredentialProvider` import re-homing, and
   `ds` token adoption. Keep ADR decisions and one-off prose as docs.
4. **XR/WebXR around the framework:** treat this as a consumer surface over Refarm, not a core
   dependency. POC packet: `specs/features/2026-06-25-xr-surface-poc.md`.
5. **Linux async I/O (`io_uring`) substrate:** evaluate as a native Rust-only capability for
   source materialization, generated vault output, and agent artifact/log workloads. It must stay
   capability-probed with fallback and cannot leak into TS public APIs.

Read [`CONVERGENCE_FACTORY_READINESS.md`](./CONVERGENCE_FACTORY_READINESS.md) before starting item
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. It records which items are execution-ready, which are deliberately gated, and
which exact spec/plan must be written next.

**To start executing:** follow [`CONVERGENCE_EXECUTION_RUNBOOK.md`](./CONVERGENCE_EXECUTION_RUNBOOK.md)
— ordered steps, branches, and verification gates.

**Integration gates (so the factory does not stop mid-build):**
- Every new package follows [`PACKAGE_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md`](./PACKAGE_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md)
  — both gate lists (`test-capabilities` + `gate-smoke-contracts`), `validate-packages`,
  build-order, ownership, and a changeset.
- Cross-repo "consumer proof" steps use [`DEV_CROSS_REPO_CONSUMPTION.md`](./DEV_CROSS_REPO_CONSUMPTION.md)
  — local tarball (`pnpm pack` → `file:`) until `@refarm.dev` packages publish.
